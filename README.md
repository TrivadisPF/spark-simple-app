# Spark Simple Application(s)

This GitHub project hosts some simple Spark applications written in Scala, Python and Java. The code has been taken from the [Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.7/quick-start.html#self-contained-applications).

It can be used to test a Spark platform and is used in some [cookbook recipes](https://github.com/TrivadisPF/platys-modern-data-platform/tree/master/cookbooks) of the `platys-modern-data-platform` stack.
